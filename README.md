<H1>INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE IN PYTHON</H1>

> STATUS: Studying!

Here is all my study during the Introduction to Data Science course, offered by the University of Michigan and issued by Coursera.
Feel free to explore this repository with me!

<h2>FIRST MODULE</h2>
Introduction to Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive computing platform. This module focuses on working with Strings and handy Python Functions for their manupulation. We then dive into CSV files and advanced Python objects, lambda and list comprehension. And last but not less important, we explore the Numpy library and its treasures.

<h2>SECOND MODULE</h2>
This module starts with the opening of the pandas library and its data structure.
